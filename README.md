# Team profile generator

## User Story

As a manager a user want to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info so that a user have quick access to their emails and GitHub profiles.

```bash
node index.js
```

This is a Node.js command line application will take information about each employees based on three different roles: 
Engineer, manager & intern.

 The first class is an `Employee` parent class with the following properties and methods:       
      * `name`
      * `id`
      * `email`
      * `getName()`
      * `getId()`
      * `getEmail()`
      * `getRole()`&mdash;returns `'Employee'`     
    * The other three classes will extend `Employee`.      
    * In addition to `Employee`'s properties and methods, `Manager` will also have the following:
      * `officeNumber`
      * `getRole()`&mdash;overridden to return `'Manager'`
    * In addition to `Employee`'s properties and methods, `Engineer` will also have the following:
      * `github`&mdash;GitHub username
      * `getGithub()`
      * `getRole()`&mdash;overridden to return `'Engineer'`
    * In addition to `Employee`'s properties and methods, `Intern` will also have the following:
      * `school`
      * `getSchool()`
      * `getRole()`&mdash;overridden to return `'Intern'`
